# FaceCard Mobile App

## FaceCard is a web Application that authenticate and allows payment using credit cards.

### This was a project I was asked to build to get into the Andela DevC programme.

* It only allows two cards type, mastercard and visa.

* It is responsive and created using javaScript, HTML5 and CSS3
